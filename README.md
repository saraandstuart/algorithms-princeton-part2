Part 2 of the Coursera Princeton Algorithms course (https://class.coursera.org/algs4partII-005).

Week 1 - WordNet
 - **SAP.java** - Represents an immutable data type for shortest ancestral paths.
 - **WordNet.java** - A WordNet represented as a directed graph.
 - **Outcast.java** - Identifies outcasts.

Week 2 - Seam Carving
 - **SeamCarver.java** - Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time.
 - **VertexWeightedDiGraph.java** - Matrix graph representation of pixel energies.
 - **Seam.java** - Algorithm for calculating the seam based on graph vertex relaxation using pixel energies.
 - **Dimension.java** - Helper class for converting two dimensional coordinates to one dimensional and vice versa.
 - **Coordinate.java** - Value object to hold 2 dimensional coordinates.
